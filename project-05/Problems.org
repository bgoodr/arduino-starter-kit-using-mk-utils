* Problem with buzzing at max potentiometer level

With this mapping function call:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
angle = map(potVal, 0, 1023, 0, 179); // <-- original line in the book
#+END_EXAMPLE

when the potentiometer is at full swing, the servo starts "buzzing"
erradically.

Lowering the maximum value down to 170 degrees causes the buzzing to
stop when the pot is at its highest setting:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
angle = map(potVal, 0, 1023, 0, 170); // <-- changed
#+END_EXAMPLE

But, of course, then the servo does not span the full 180 degrees.
